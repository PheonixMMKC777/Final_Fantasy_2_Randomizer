# Final Fantasy II Randomizer

Currently can Randomize the following 

**Random Shops, Tiered Shops, Player Party, Base Stats, Main/Offhands, Party Select, Treasures, and a bunch of fun modes!**

If your not powershell savvy run the RUNME.bat

If you get an error saying this below

    File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see
    about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess!! 

1. Click the windows button and type powershell.
2. In the little menu on the right, click run as administrator.
3. type this commmand:	**set-executionpolicy unrestricted**
4. At the prompt press Y to enable the script.
5. Now the script will run
     
# Current Bugs

Using the Offhand Randomizer will overwrite Party Select/Random Party Randomization, so dont use them together.

Also you cannot use tiered and randomized shops at the same time :/

Spoiler File doenst work properly, if at all
