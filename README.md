# Final_Fantasy_2_Randomizer

Currently can Randomize the following 

**Shop Items, Tiered Shops, Player Party, Base Stats, Main/Offhands, Party Select**

**Also Random player party crashes sometimes, so if it dont work the first time, give it another try :(**


If your not powershell savvy run the RUNME.exe

If you get an error saying "Scripts are disbled on this machine"

      1. Run powershell as an administrator
      2. Enter this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
      3. Press Enter
      4. Press "Y" or "A" then press enter
      Powershell Scripts should now be enabled to run on your machine.
